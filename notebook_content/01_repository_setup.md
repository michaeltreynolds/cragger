# Part 1: Repository Setup (5 min)

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

Before we begin in Colab, you need your own copy of the conference-rag repository:

1. Go to: **https://github.com/byu-cs-452/conference-rag**
2. Click **"Fork"** in the top right corner
3. Under "Repository name", keep it as `conference-rag` (or rename if you prefer)
4. **Uncheck** "Copy the `main` branch only" if prompted (we only have `main`, but just in case)
5. Click **"Create fork"**

You now have your own copy at: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/conference-rag`

> ⚠️ **Important:** From this point forward, you'll be working in **your fork** — not the original `byu-cs-452` repo. Make sure you're editing files in your own copy!

> 💡 **Why fork?** Forking is a fundamental Git workflow used in open source. Your fork is your own copy that you can freely modify, while still being connected to the original repo for updates.

### Make your fork public

Your fork must be **public** for free GitHub Pages hosting and for opening the notebook in Google Colab:

1. In your forked repo, go to **Settings** → **General**
2. Scroll to **"Danger Zone"** at the bottom
3. If repo is private, click **"Change visibility"** → **Make public**

> 💡 If the original repo is public, your fork will default to public — you may not need to change anything.

✅ **You're all set!** Continue below to configure your project.
