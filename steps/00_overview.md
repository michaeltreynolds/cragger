# 🎓 Conference RAG — Overview

## What You'll Build

A **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that lets users ask questions about General Conference talks using semantic search and AI-generated answers.

Your app has three search modes that **light up** as you complete each milestone:

```
🏁 LAUNCH ──→ 🔐 SIGN IN ──→ 🔍 KEYWORD ──→ 🧠 SEMANTIC ──→ 🤖 RAG ──→ 🚀 YOURS
  "I have       "I can         First           Second          All          Personal
   a site!"      log in!"      green           green          green!        feature
                                light!          light!
```

| Mode | What It Does | Lights Up When |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 🔍 **Keyword Search** | SQL `ILIKE` query on talk text | Conference data imported |
| 🧠 **Semantic Search** | Vector similarity search with pgvector | Embeddings generated + Edge Function deployed |
| 🤖 **Ask a Question (RAG)** | AI-generated answers with source citations | All Edge Functions deployed |

## Architecture

```

## What You'll Learn

1. **Vector Embeddings** — Representing text as searchable numbers
2. **Semantic Search** — Finding similar content with cosine similarity
3. **RAG Architecture** — Combining retrieval + generation
4. **Edge Functions** — Serverless compute for secure API management
5. **Row Level Security** — Database-level access control
6. **Production Deployment** — Full-stack app on GitHub Pages + Supabase

## Before You Start

**You'll need:**
- [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account (free tier)
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (~$0.60 usage)
- Python 3.9+ installed locally
- An AI coding assistant (pick one):
  - **Antigravity** (VS Code-based IDE) — [antigravity.google](https://antigravity.google)
  - **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code extension) — VS Code Marketplace
  - **Cursor** (standalone IDE) — [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)

> 💡 **Pro tip**: Throughout this assignment, whenever you’re stuck or curious, ask your AI assistant! For example:
> - *"What is a vector embedding?"*
> - *"Why do we use cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distance?"*
> - *"Explain what Row Level Security does in Supabase"*

## Cost & Time

- 💰 **~$0.60** in OpenAI API usage
- ⏱️ **~2 hours** total across all steps
