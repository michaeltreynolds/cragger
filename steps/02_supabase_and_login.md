## What You'll Learn
- What Supabase is and why we use it (Postgres + Auth + Edge Functions as a service)
- How API keys and access tokens work
- The difference between `anon` (public) and `service_role` (admin) keys
- How magic link authentication works

## Why This Matters

Your app needs a database, authentication, and serverless functions. Instead of setting up three separate services, Supabase bundles them all together. Once you configure it, you'll be able to **log in to your own site** — a satisfying proof that your backend is connected.

## What to Do

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up / sign in
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `conference-rag` (or anything you like)
   - **Database Password**: Choose a strong password (save it!)
   - **Region**: Choose the one closest to you
4. Click **"Create new project"** — takes ~2 minutes to provision

### 2. Collect Your Credentials

You need values for **two config files**. Here's where to find each one:

#### config.public.json (safe to commit)

| Credential | Where to Find It |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Settings → API → Project URL |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Settings → API → `anon` `public` key |

#### config.secret.json (never commit!)

| Credential | Where to Find It |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Settings → API → `service_role` key (click "Reveal") |
| `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` | Extract from your URL: `https://XXXXX.supabase.co` → `XXXXX` |
| `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | [Account Tokens page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens) → Generate new token |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) → Create new secret key |

### 3. Fill In Your Config Files

**config.public.json:**
```json
{
    "SUPABASE_URL": "https://xyzabc123.supabase.co",
    "SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "eyJ..."
}
```

**config.secret.json:**
```json
{
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-proj-...",
    "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "sbp_...",
    "SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF": "xyzabc123",
    "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY": "eyJ..."
}
```

> 💡 **Ask your AI assistant**: *"What is the difference between the Supabase anon key and the service role key? Why is one safe to put in client-side code?"*

### 4. Push & Configure Auth

Commit and push your public config:

```bash
git add config.public.json
git commit -m "Add Supabase public credentials"
git push
```

Then configure the magic link redirect:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
2. Under "Redirect URLs", add **both** of these:
   - `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/conference-rag/` (deployed site)
   - `http://localhost:5500/` (for local development)

> ⚠️ **If you skip this step**, clicking the magic link will redirect to the wrong URL and login will fail.

### 5. Test Login

1. Wait ~1 minute for GitHub Pages to redeploy
2. Visit your deployed site
3. Enter your email and click "Sign In with Magic Link"
4. Check your inbox and click the link
5. You should be logged in! ✅

**Expected behavior**: You can log in, but all three search modes show **"Not Ready"** with red lights — that's correct! They'll light up as you complete the remaining steps.

> ⚠️ **Rate limit warning**: Supabase's free tier limits magic link emails to **3 per hour**. If you stop receiving emails, just wait and try again. Check spam too!

> 💡 **Ask your AI assistant**: *"How do magic link logins work? What are the security advantages over passwords?"*

## Verification

- [ ] Supabase project is created and accessible at your dashboard
- [ ] `config.public.json` has your URL and anon key
- [ ] `config.secret.json` has all four secret values filled in
- [ ] Magic link login works on your deployed site
- [ ] You see three search panels with red "Not Ready" indicators

## 🎉 Milestone: You can log in to YOUR site!
